## important links that helped working on this challenge
[1](https://replit.com/@Algorand/Getting-Started-with-Go) and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFG7Zo2JvIY) helped a lot with environment setup and test

[3](https://developer.algorand.org/articles/my-algo-asset-manager/) was very intrumental to me as it helped me from a visual standpoint break the tasks into smaller chunks <br/>
at this point i became fully aware of what was expected of the "system" i am working on and with(sdk)

# challenges
using the latest sdk version was quite tough for me, seeing that lots of the documentation <br/>
centered around the v2, which i found more interesting to work with.

# improvement
short-term is writing my unit tests, seeing that my node is locally setup I can get to it <br/>
should time be on my side
